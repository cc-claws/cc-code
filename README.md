## Why cc-code?

| Comparison | Other Terminal Agents | cc-code |
|------------|----------------------|------|
| Runtime | Node.js / Bun, easily eats 1GB RAM | Rust native, fast startup, ~50MB memory |
| Model Lock-in | Locked to one LLM | Switch freely: Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, DeepSeek, GLM |
| Prompt Cache | Recompute every turn, wasting tokens | Frozen system prompt, 95-99% cache hit rate |
| Tool Loading | All tools stuffed into every request | Core tools resident, rest lazy-loaded via Tool Search |
| IDE Integration | Terminal only | ACP protocol, Zed and other IDEs connect directly |
| `.claude/` Ecosystem | Incompatible | Use `.claude/` config, agents, skills, hooks, MCP directly |
| Safety Gate | Prompts you for every risky command | JEV semantic gate — a dedicated LLM judge that only prompts when it isn't sure |

---

## Auto Mode: The JEV Semantic Gate

`Auto` is the default permission mode (fail-closed). Instead of asking you about every call, it decides in two layers:

- **Deterministic layer** — your own rules, the built-in hard-deny list, and a read-only fast lane. Zero cost, no credentials required.
- **JEV semantic gate** — a dedicated LLM judge (`JEV_MODEL`, default `openrouter/typesafe/jev-1.13`) reached over its own endpoint (`JEV_ENDPOINT`) with its own key (`JEV_API_KEY`). It scores each call against a set of conditions and pops a single confirmation prompt only when the call lands in the uncertain band.

No credentials configured? The deterministic layer still runs and an LLM classifier takes over as fallback; when there is no confirmation channel (sub-agents, `-p`) the call is denied. The session model is never involved — judging is offloaded to JEV, so safety checks don't spend your context tokens. `Shift+Tab` toggles between `Auto` and `Bypass`.

> For deep-dive architecture, fallback classifiers, and troubleshooting, see the [Auto Mode & Permissions Guide](docs/auto-mode-guide.md).

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Rust Native** | Fast startup, low memory, zero runtime overhead |
| **Context Optimized** | System prompt frozen + dynamic content isolated, no token waste |
| **Multi-LLM Support** | Anthropic / OpenAI-compatible APIs, DeepSeek, GLM — switch freely |
| **`.claude/` Ecosystem Compatible** | `.claude/` config, agents, skills, hooks, MCP, sub-agents all reusable |
| **Streaming Markdown** | Code blocks, tables, diffs rendered in real-time |
| **ACP Protocol** | Connect to Zed and other IDEs, or build your own "Cloud Code" platform |
| **Auto Compact** | Long sessions auto-compressed, stays fast and cheap |
| **Sub-Agent Concurrency** | Background sub-agents run in parallel with fork and background modes |
| **HITL Approval** | Sensitive operations intercepted by the JEV semantic gate — a dedicated LLM judge that only prompts when it isn't sure |
| **Dual-Engine File Search** | Grep/Glob prefer the external ripgrep binary, falling back to the built-in Rust engine |

### v0.6.x New Features

**Approval dialogs with descriptions and full-file diffs (v0.6.206):** When a tool call carries a `description`, the approval dialog shows it on its own line under the title. `Write`/`Edit` approvals now preview the full before/after file diff (new files get a numbered, syntax-highlighted code preview instead), falling back to the fragment diff when the file can't be read, is over the limit, or the fragment can't be located on disk. The dialog layout and colors follow the reference implementation: full-width solid rule on top, dashed rules around the body, numbered options and a fixed shortcut hint. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Grep / Glob aligned with the latest reference spec (v0.6.202):** `Grep` descriptions now stress integration with the permission-review UI and clickable `file_path:line_number` links, document ripgrep escaping and multi-line patterns, and add a `context` alias (equivalent to `-C`); `Glob` returns cwd-relative paths newest-first, rejects literal `"undefined"` / `"null"`, reports `No files found` uniformly on no match, and uses the standard truncation message. Both the ripgrep engine and the pure-Rust engine relativize paths, and the system prompt now steers Grep/Glob first instead of bare `grep`/`rg`/`find` in a shell. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Project hooks and user/plugin agent definitions (v0.6.199):** Hooks from the project's `.claude/settings.json` are now actually loaded (previously only global hooks were read and project hooks silently never ran); trust them explicitly with `cc-code trust-project` (or `CC_CODE_TRUST_PROJECT_HOOKS=1`). Agent definitions are now also found at the user level (`~/.claude/agents/`) and from plugins, with lookup order project > user > plugin > built-in. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Scrolling and input responsiveness (v0.6.201):** Input processing continues while the background renderer prepares a layout. Stable scrolling reuses the prepared width, and input, streaming output and background updates share one redraw schedule. Fullscreen transitions, resizing and selection copying keep their frame order. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Read-only Bash in tool groups (v0.6.197):** File-inspection Bash (`ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `rg`, `find`, `head`, `awk`, …) now folds into the same read-only group as `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob`, with the collapsed summary reading `ran N shell commands` beside `read` / `searched`. Classification is purely lexical on the frontend — the model no longer passes a `file_inspect` argument (removed from the tool schema) — and it tolerates `2>/dev/null` / `2>&1` / `>&2` as well as separators and `>` inside quotes. Thinking rows collapsed into one-line summaries: `∴ Thinking for Ns, …` while running, `  Thought for Ns, …` once frozen, with the body behind `Ctrl+O`. Auto-compact no longer clears the message area, and the stuck detector no longer mistakes consecutive edits for a loop. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Collapsed file-inspection Bash (v0.6.195):** Bash calls that only read files can now fold into the read-only tool group. The model flags them with the optional `file_inspect` argument (a single command counts too), the collapsed summary reads `ran N shell commands` beside `read` / `searched`, failed commands keep their exit code and stderr in the collapsed view, and `Ctrl+O` expands every command and its output. Running, backgrounded and explicitly-timed-out commands never fold, so live output and `Ctrl+B` stay untouched. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Image attachment links (v0.6.192):** Each sent image gets a `  ⎿  [Image #N]` line below your message. With a saved path and OSC 8 enabled, the reference opens the local image in supported terminals (kept in its own soft color, no artificial underline, never recolored link-blue). `DISABLE_HYPERLINKS=1` or a missing path leaves plain text; save failures do not block sending. Images use the system temp directory, and links are not guaranteed after restoring a session. Phase 1 does not send local paths to the model. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full scope.

**Skill workflows (v0.6.191):** Matching tasks use the core `Skill` tool, while `/skill-name args` loads instructions directly. Skill cards show a compact loading result; `context: fork` waits for an isolated agent, and active skill instructions survive compaction. See [skill behavior](./spec/global/domains/skill-trigger.md).

**Interface language:** TUI and CLI help support English and Simplified Chinese. Use `/lang en` or `/lang zh-CN` to save your preference. Without a saved language, startup detects `LC_ALL`, `LANGUAGE`, `LC_MESSAGES` and `LANG`; unsupported locales fall back to English. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for unreleased changes.

**Typing UX aligned with the reference implementation (v0.6.166):** Suggestion overlays (slash commands / skills / @ files) are now interactive while the agent is running — arrows/Tab navigate, Enter completes only a selected candidate, Esc dismisses the overlay first and interrupts the agent on a second press. "Send now" (steer) with a foreground command running waits a 2s grace period, then moves it to the background automatically. The status-bar permission label now shows a `⏵⏵` prefix. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Sub-agent cancellation (v0.6.139):** Just tell the main agent to stop a sub-task — it calls `Agent(action="stop", task_id="bg-…")` to cancel by exact `task_id` (**no fuzzy matching**, so look-alike sibling tasks are never stopped by mistake). The receipt carries the task summary so the agent can confirm what it stopped; the timeline prints `• Agent "x" was stopped by main Agent`, and the drawer row turns into a **red filled `●`** with `stopped by main Agent` (keyboard stops show `stopped by user`). While waiting, the main viewport shows `✻ Waiting for N background agents to finish`.

**Sub-agent prompt cards (v0.6.139):** Press `Ctrl+O` in the main viewport to switch detailed mode; the launch summary of background sub-tasks then turns from the compact tree into classic tool cards — `● Agent(task preview)` + `  └ Backgrounded agent` + `  └ Prompt:` followed by the **full** instruction text (6-column hanging indent, wrapped). Press `Ctrl+O` again to collapse. See [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for unreleased changes.

| Feature | Version | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Welcome Page Shows Active Kernel & Polished `/kernel` Switching** | v0.6.258 | The welcome page now displays the current session's Agent Kernel, and `/kernel` opens a cc / dsh / pi selection panel; a successful switch fires the same short notification used for model switches (same toast position, 2.5s). The welcome page, session metadata and the ACP client stay in sync on create / history restore / switch receipts; duplicate operations and session switches are blocked while a kernel request is in flight, with drafts preserved and queued messages deferred (#967). |
| **Diff +/- Marker Moves to the Right of the Line Number** | v0.6.256 | The diff `+` / `-` marker used to render left of the line number (`+ 25 content`); it now renders on the right (`  25 + content`) — two-space prefix + right-aligned line number + space + marker, with the context-line marker slot moved alongside so the line-number column stays aligned. Applies to every diff rendering path (tool result details, HITL approval popups, where removed lines keep the U+2212 minus); new-file previews are unaffected, and decoration-color layering plus body highlighting are unchanged (#964, #965). |
| **Command Hook exec form args Support** | v0.6.255 | Third-party desktop tools on Windows often write hooks as `command` + `args` (exec form, reference-implementation 2.1.139+ semantics). `HookType::Command` previously had no `args` field, so serde silently dropped the arguments and handed the whole `command` string to `cmd /C` — an executable path containing spaces (e.g. `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`) got shredded, failing every such hook with exit 1. When `args` is non-empty the hook now launches `command` directly as the executable with `args` as argv (no shell), applying `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` / `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` / `$ARGUMENTS` substitution per item; `args`-less legacy configs keep the existing platform shell routing, and the `shell` field is ignored under exec form (#954, #955). |
| **Panel Close Shrinks Viewport Back to Content** | v0.6.254 | Opening `Ctrl+P` command palette and cancelling left the page blank — welcome card at top, input/status bar floating mid-screen with a large empty gap below: the growing viewport's height memory never shrank, so the panel's expanded height was remembered forever. Panel (transient block) rows no longer enter the persistent memory; closing a panel immediately reclaims the height, explicitly clears the released rows (no ghost remnants), and the viewport top edge falls back to the startup anchor. Input-editing jitter protection and the fullscreen latch are unchanged (#951, #952). |
| **LLM-provided Thinking Duration Preserved (TTFT Included)** | v0.6.252 | `Thought for 1s` could show for a nearly one-minute thinking session: the TUI-side group timer (anchored at the first reasoning chunk, excluding TTFT) unconditionally overwrote the LLM adapter's TTFT-inclusive `duration_ms` on every render pass. The LLM value now takes priority with the group timer as fallback only (floor 1s); group timing is redefined as the wall clock of one contiguous thinking stretch (tool runtime excluded, boundaries only at reasoning/tool edges, cleared per round); multi-row frozen thinking rows each consume their own group value (fixing an off-by-one that showed the same duration on two rows); text chunks no longer flood group timing with near-zero values (#945, #946). |
| **Reliable SessionEnd on Window Close / Exit & session_id Alignment Across Hook Payloads** | v0.6.251 | Closing the window on Windows (`CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT`) was unhandled and never fired `SessionEnd`, leaving sessions stuck at "working" in hook consumers like clawd that aggregate by session id; the normal-exit and `/clear` paths also hard-coded an empty session id, and async hook notifications could be dropped when the runtime shut down early. Window close now fires `SessionEnd` synchronously from a 500ms-refreshed global snapshot in the handler thread (3.5s cap plus an atomic once-guard so it never double-fires with a normal exit); all three `SessionEnd` paths carry the real session id with CC-aligned reasons (window close `other`, `/clear` `clear`, prompt-visible exit `prompt_input_exit`), the exit path awaits async hooks to completion, and SubagentStart / SubagentStop finally receive the real session id instead of `""` (#941, #942). |
| **Unified `Search` Header with Path for Glob / Grep** | v0.6.246 | Both Glob and Grep now render as `Search` in the message view (matching the reference implementation's `userFacingName`), and the header summary changes from a bare pattern to `pattern: "…", path: "…"`, with the path collapsed to a relative form inside the cwd. Execution-only flags (`-n`, `-i`, `-A/-B/-C`, `output_mode`) stay out of the header, while the status-bar `✓ Name ×N` counters keep the real tool names so two `Search` rows never collide (#923). |
| **Status Bar & Tool-Name Polish, Native `git diff` Output** | v0.6.244 | Unifies the status bar hint casing (lowercase `ctrl+o` / `ctrl+p` / `:detail` / `:settings`) and renames the permission labels to `auto mode on` / `bypass permissions on`; removes the transient bold/highlight timer on `Shift+Tab` mode switches to stop the flicker. `!git diff` output is no longer re-rendered into a summary/line-number diff card — native Git file headers, `@@` hunks, `+/-` lines and ANSI colors are preserved. Tool names revert to the softer `text_soft` shade after #906 briefly brightened them (#906, #908, #910, #912, #914). |
| **Runtime Agent Kernel Switching (cc / dsh / pi)** | v0.6.241 | Seamlessly switch between `cc` (reference implementation), `dsh` (Devin-style shell), and `pi` (streaming lightweight) agent kernels at runtime via `agent_kernel` setting or `/kernel` command. Dialect translation ensures identical tool execution and approval contracts across kernels while preserving byte-for-byte equivalence for `cc` (#826, #903). Also adds LaTeX math rendering with Unicode purification for inline `$...$` and display `$$...$$` (#901, #902). |
| **MSYS Drive Path Support for File Tools** | v0.6.240 | Windows callers often pass Git Bash-style paths like `/c/Users/...`. Such a path has a root but no drive letter, so `is_absolute()` is false and `Path::join` drops the cwd and resolves against the "current drive root", making the lookup drift with process state until it ends in `File not found`; the error echoed only the raw input, which made it look like the path form itself was rejected. `msys_drive_path()` now rewrites `/c/foo` to `C:/foo` before `resolve_path`, the same conversion is wired into Grep / rg_engine search paths, and the not-found message echoes the resolved path. Windows only; `/cc/...`, `/1/...` and relative paths are untouched (#899, #900). |
> Older releases (v0.6.0 – v0.6.235) are listed in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Install

Binaries available for macOS (x86_64 / Apple Silicon), Linux (x86_64 / aarch64), and Windows (x86_64).

### npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @cc-claw/code
```

No install script runs: the binary ships as a platform-specific optional
dependency (`@cc-claw/code-<platform>-<arch>`), and npm picks the one that
matches your OS and architecture. That means plain installs, `--ignore-scripts`,
pnpm and bun all work, and nothing is fetched from GitHub at install time.

> [!NOTE]
> Installing with `--omit=optional` / `--no-optional` leaves the package without
> its binary; `cc-code` then exits with a message explaining how to reinstall.

Windows on ARM has no native build yet — install the x64 build explicitly with
`npm install -g --arch=x64 @cc-claw/code`.

### Upgrade

```bash
npm update -g @cc-claw/code
```

### macOS / Linux (Script)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-claws/cc-code/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-claws/cc-code/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

## How We Built cc-code with Nobody Coding

**Nobody Coding** means exactly what it sounds like. No human wrote a single line of cc-code — not the architecture, not the TUI, not the harness tuning that makes open-source models reliable in an Agent loop. Humans decide *what*. AI figures out *how*. You're not pair programming — you're product managing an engineer that never sleeps. 99% of cc-code was built this way.

> Recent commits are almost entirely DeepSeek, Mimo, and GLM. Claude was just there in the beginning.
