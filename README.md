# cc-code

**Terminal coding agent powered by open-source models — Rust-built, Claude Code compatible**

DeepSeek-V4-Pro + Mimo-2.5Pro + GLM-5.1 driven, zero migration from `.claude/` config, runs on RISC-V.

## Why cc-code?

| Comparison | Other Terminal Agents | cc-code |
|------------|----------------------|------|
| Runtime | Node.js / Bun, easily eats 1GB RAM | Rust native, fast startup, ~50MB memory |
| Model Lock-in | Locked to one LLM | Switch freely: Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, DeepSeek, GLM |
| Prompt Cache | Recompute every turn, wasting tokens | Frozen system prompt, 95-99% cache hit rate |
| Tool Loading | All tools stuffed into every request | Core tools resident, rest lazy-loaded via Tool Search |
| IDE Integration | Terminal only | ACP protocol, Zed and other IDEs connect directly |
| Claude Code Ecosystem | Incompatible | Use `.claude/` config, agents, skills, hooks, MCP directly |

---

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Rust Native** | Fast startup, low memory, zero runtime overhead |
| **Context Optimized** | System prompt frozen + dynamic content isolated, no token waste |
| **Multi-LLM Support** | Anthropic / OpenAI-compatible APIs, DeepSeek, GLM — switch freely |
| **Claude Code Compatible** | `.claude/` config, agents, skills, hooks, MCP, sub-agents all reusable |
| **Streaming Markdown** | Code blocks, tables, diffs rendered in real-time |
| **ACP Protocol** | Connect to Zed and other IDEs, or build your own "Cloud Code" platform |
| **Auto Compact** | Long sessions auto-compressed, stays fast and cheap |
| **Sub-Agent Concurrency** | Background sub-agents run in parallel with fork and background modes |
| **HITL Approval** | Sensitive operations auto-intercepted with auto-classifier and shared-mode |
| **Nobody Coding** | 99% of code produced by DeepSeek, Mimo, and GLM — humans decide what, AI figures out how |

## How We Built cc-code with Nobody Coding

**Nobody Coding** means exactly what it sounds like. No human wrote a single line of cc-code — not the architecture, not the TUI, not the harness tuning that makes open-source models reliable in an Agent loop. Humans decide *what*. AI figures out *how*. You're not pair programming — you're product managing an engineer that never sleeps. 99% of cc-code was built this way.

> Recent commits are almost entirely DeepSeek, Mimo, and GLM. Claude was just there in the beginning.

### Typical Workflow

| When you... | Pipeline kicks off |
|---|---|
| **Find a bug or piece of tech debt** | `issue-create` → `systematic-debugging` → `writing-plans` → `subagent-driven-development` → `issue-archive` → improve CLAUDE.md |
| **Want to build a new feature** | `grill-me` → `writing-plans` → `subagent-driven-development` |
| **Notice the codebase getting messy** | `slop-cleaner` → `improve-codebase-architecture` → `writing-plans` → `subagent-driven-development` |
| **Need someone to grok the architecture** | `teacher` → assign a task → `teacher` |
